# Facial-Recognized-Attendance-System
Final Year Project:



*Description:*
            In colleges and school there is paper based attendance which is time comsuming, if multiple Face Detection and Recognition is  implemented for taking attandance then we can buy more time for Knowledge gaining (:P who does that).
            
            
In this repo we have three .py files:
                                      1. face_dataset.py
                                      2. training.py
                                      3. face_recognition.py
